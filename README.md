#QuickSet
QuickSet is an AI-powered conversational platform for fast and effortless appointment scheduling. Our goal is to minimize user effort—ideally reducing the process to just a natural language query—by leveraging Large Language Models (LLMs) and real-time API integrations.

#Goal
To enable users to book appointments with minimal clicks or input, using natural language conversations. QuickSet uses an LLM to understand user intent, select the correct service, extract necessary details, and interact with third-party appointment APIs to complete the booking process—automatically.

#Example
User: “My brakes are squeaky and I need a check-up sometime this week.”
LLM: “Got it. I can book a brake inspection for you. What’s your car make and model?”
User: “Honda Accord 2019”
LLM: “And your zip code?”
User: “48104”
LLM: “Perfect. Let me find the nearest Tires Plus with brake inspection availability this week...” → [Books appointment] → [Returns confirmation]
