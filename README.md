# QuickSet

**QuickSet** is an AI-powered conversational platform for fast and effortless appointment scheduling. Our goal is to minimize user effortâ€”ideally reducing the process to just a natural language queryâ€”by leveraging Large Language Models (LLMs) and real-time API integrations.

## ðŸš€ Goal

To enable users to **book appointments with minimal clicks or input**, using natural language conversations. QuickSet uses an LLM to:

- Understand user intent
- Identify the correct type of service
- Extract all required details
- Submit the data to external appointment booking APIs

The entire process is automatic, intuitive, and optimized for speed and simplicity.
